### Track usage not users

We believe privacy advocates are doing a great job by creating better website analytical tools like [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) and [Simple Analytics](https://www.simpleanalytics.com/). However, video services like Youtube and Vimeo are becoming more privacy invasive. It's Google Analytics on steroid. We think if you want to know how your videos are performing on your site, you don't need to track your users - instead; Mave Metrics tracks usage.
